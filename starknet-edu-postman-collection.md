# Postman Installation
The StarkNet EDU team has assembled a Postman workspace that includes relevant API calls for developing and testing your Cairo code in various environments. I recommend the desktop version: https://www.postman.com/downloads

Once downloaded search in the search bar and select the workspace “starknet-edu” . Verify the id is correct: 5cf35dcd-9230–4e4a-aa1e-c52a4e910d02(info icon next to “workplace settings”). Notice the environments drop down on the top right:

# Fork Collections and relevant Environments
Select the ellipses(three dots) on the right of each collection. Then select “create fork”. Navigate to the Environments tab on the left nav and do the same for the environments.
